For 12 weeks of the summer 2016, I interned at the [Met Office Informatics lab][informatics lab]. 

In a nutshell, the lab makes technological prototypes that makes exploring data more useful.

On the lab's blog you can read about [my time in the lab][internship summary] and some of the projects I was involved with, such as the [augmented reality interactive sandpit][interactive sandpit] and [the great big rhino project][rhino project].

You can also read about my experience at [Mozilla Festival 2016][mozfest], an annual open technology conference that I was invited to attend alongside the Informatics Lab team.

Thanks to the lab, my approach to learning new technologies is much more confident and is a major reason this website and it's content exists.
